# pitch.py
python script for repitching audio by whole semitones based on BPM

# usage
place script in desired location. naviage to that location using the terminal, the command is ````cd location/of/enclosing/folder```` run the script using ````python pitch.py x```` where x is the BPM of the audio. you can find this out on most DAW's, if you're interested in using this, you will probably know how.

the output will then show the new BPM for shifting the audio by various semitones. rememember to put your DAW in "repitch" mode for this, and not "timestretch" or similar!
